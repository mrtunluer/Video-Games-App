# Video Games App

The app I developed using <a href="https://rawg.io/apidocs" target="_blank">RAWG api</a> based on <a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture?gclid=Cj0KCQjwyMiTBhDKARIsAAJ-9VuisYVaXZI7LAL3mtc7BdxY6oRFbzvhC69u1Gpatcav2ynEw5nJaYwaAs0GEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Mvvm architecture</a>.

Don't forget to change Utils -> Constants -> API_KEY = "yourOwnApiKey"
